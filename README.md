# Template-Practice-2
This is my practice project with html and css.

I am excited to share that I have recently uploaded my first project on GitHub. This project was created using HTML and CSS only, and it was inspired by the W3Schools website's space theme. As a beginner in programming, I acknowledge that my project may not be of the highest quality, but I am actively working on improving my skills.

I would greatly appreciate it if you could take a moment to review my project. Your feedback and suggestions would be invaluable to me as I continue my learning journey.

While I am aware that I have a lot to learn, I am committed to enhancing the project's quality and my programming abilities. Any guidance or advice you can offer would be highly appreciated.

Thank you for taking the time to consider my request.
